## Purpose

1. Assess your emotional and mental health with screeners and dynamic triage.
2. Guide you immediately with coping tools and micro-interventions.
3. Support your longer-term care with plans, pathway builders, nudges, and handoff summaries.

The UI is colorful, theme-driven, and animation-enhanced to make wellbeing activities feel warm and engaging.
